Codes for Paper "Tensor-based Feedback Control for Locally Structured High-dimensional Streaming Data under Limited Control Capability"

All simulation codes are saved under “./basic/”:

1. For 2D case,
   
(1) “./basic/estimate_2D.py”: offline training.

(2) “./basic/control_L1_2D.py”: online control.

(3) “./basic/utils_2D/” saves utility functions.

(4) “./basic/2D/” saves data and results.

2. For 3D case,
   
(1) “./basic/estimate_3D.py”: offline training.

(2) “./basic/control_L1_3D.py”: online control.

(3) “./basic/utils_3D/” saves utility functions.

(4) “./basic/3D/” saves data and results.

All codes for case study are saved under “./case_CFA/”:

(1) “./case_CFA/estimate_case.py”: offline training.

(2) “./case_CFA/control_L1_case.py”: online control.

(3) “./case_CFA/utils_case/” saves utility functions.

(4) “./case_CFA/case/” saves data and results.
